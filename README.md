  Agriculture plays a vital role in Indiaâ€™s Economy. Over 60 % of the rural households depend
on agriculture as their principal means of livelihood. However, the farmers of India have been 
facing a lot of real time challenges like crop diseases which leads to reduced crop yield and 
economic losses. Plant diseases have emerged as a significant threat to the agricultural 
landscape, impacting the livelihoods of millions of farmers. The lack of timely and accurate 
diagnosis exacerbates the problem, as farmers struggle to identify and address diseases affecting 
their crops.
  This project addresses the pressing need for an efficient Plant Disease Detection System in 
agriculture. We begin by highlighting the current challenges faced by farmers due to plant 
diseases, emphasizing the detrimental impact on crop health and overall agricultural 
productivity.
  To comprehensively tackle this issue, we delve into the major plant diseases affecting crops, 
providing insights into their characteristics and implications. Recognizing the urgency for 
advanced technology in agriculture, we outline the requirements for a Deep Learning System, 
emphasizing its potential in revolutionizing disease detection and prevention.
Our proposed approach employs transfer learning to develop a robust Plant Disease 
Detection System that combines plant classification from leaves with precise identification of 
diseases. We specifically focus on implementing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, 
including DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50 V2, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB3, 
EffiecientNetB4 , and Xception to leverage their pre-trained models for enhanced accuracy.
The project evaluates and compares the performance of DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, 
ResNet50 V2, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB3, EffiecientNetB4, and Xception in terms of 
validation accuracy and prediction criteria. This comparative analysis aims to identify the most 
effective model for accurate and efficient plant disease detection, contributing to the 
advancement of smart agriculture and ensuring sustainable food production.
After fulfilment of the proposed task, there is a scope of developing a high-performance and 
efficient Plant Disease Detection System for mobile applications. Through a comparative 
analysis, the most effective deep learning model, such as DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, 
ResNet50 V2, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB3, EffiecientNetB4 or Xception will be identified and 
implemented. This endeavour aims to provide farmers with a user-friendly tool for swift and 
accurate plant disease diagnosis on mobile platforms. In conclusion, the identified best performing deep learning model will be integrated into a user-friendly mobile application for 
Plant Disease Detection. This implementation ensures an accessible and efficient solution, 
empowering farmers with a practical tool to safeguard their crops and enhance agricultural 
sustainability

## Introduction
  Agriculture plays an important role in the Indian economy. Plant disease identification is 
the key to preventing losses in yield as well as agricultural product quantity. On the other 
hand, some factors like temperature, sunlight, soil moisture, pathogens, and nutrition affect 
the growth of plants. Among those factors, pathogens are the major factor that leads to the 
destruction of the plant. To eradicate these pathogens, farmers use pesticides. Without 
identifying the type of pathogen, it is not advised to use any kind of pesticide.

## Problem Statement
  Plant diseases are impacting agriculture in general and monoculture more precisely. The 
traditional way to deal with the detection of plant diseases is by visual inspection of the 
leaves, stems or some chemical processes by experts.
  This is time-consuming and costs a lot for the farmers. This operation of detecting 
plant diseases is expensive since the farmers must consult experts, and time-consuming as 
those experts need time to detect the disease and classify its type and need continuous 
control.
  Knowing that some farmers could not have the capability to consult the experts 
regularly, so the risk of contagion between plants is extremely high. Also, this will have 
serious impacts on the environment due to the extensive use of chemicals and pesticides 
that are used in random quantities; also, the production process is affected.
